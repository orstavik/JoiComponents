<h3>Explanation: </h3>
First, the flattened DOM looks like this:
<pre>
...
  < the-father >
    #shadowRoot                   * slotchange listener
      < the-child >
        #shadowRoot               * slotchange listener
          < slot#child >
            < slot#father >
              matroska
</pre>

Take note of two things:
<ol>
  <li>
    The slot elements appear in reverse document order.
  </li>
  <li>
    The slotchange event listeners are attached to the #shadowRoot of each element.
    This causes the inner web component to be triggered first and then the outer web component.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the slotchange event listener were attached to the slot elements instead,
    then they would run in reverse document order.
  </li>
</ol>

Creating this DOM produces three logs:
<pre>
THE-CHILD  SLOT#child
THE-CHILD  SLOT#father
THE-FATHER SLOT#father
</pre>

<ol>
  <li>
    The first log output comes from slot#father being transposed into slot#child.
    The event start bubbling from the slot#child, is then caught by the event listener on the-child#shadowRoot,
    and finally stopped by the border between < the-child > host element and its #shadowRoot.
    <pre>
...
  < the-father >
    #shadowRoot
      < the-child >                        _
        #shadowRoot                        *1
          < slot#child >       slotchange  ^
            < slot#father >
              matroska
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    The second and third log output is produced by the same(!) slotchange event.
    The event occurs when the "matroska" text node is being transposed into slot#father.
    The event then bubbles up, and because it is "composed: false", it is stopped by the border
    between the-child and its #shadowRoot. However, because the slot elements remain in the flattened
    DOM in reverse document order as a SlotMatroska, the slotchange event listener on both the
    the-father and the-child element are triggered. Producing two outputs.
    <pre>
...
  < the-father >                          _
    #shadowRoot                             *3
      < the-child >                        |
        #shadowRoot                         *2
          < slot#child >                   |
            < slot#father >slotchange  ^
              matroska
</pre>
  </li>
</ol>
