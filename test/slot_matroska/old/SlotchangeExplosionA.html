<h3>SlotchangeExplosion #1</h3>

We start viewing the situation from HTML.
<ol>
  <li>
    A portrait-frame with a bunch of pre children are declared in the top most lightDOM.
  </li>
  <li>
    The portrait-frame has a slot with a green-frame element that it chains its slot element to.
  </li>
  <li>
    The green-frame has a slot element.
  </li>
  <li>
    From the perspective of HTML, the declaration of the portrait-frame should trigger one relevant
    slotchange event as the pre elements are transposed from the topmost lightDOM to the slot inside green-frame.
  </li>
</ol>

In JS, you (most likely) see two slotchange events. Why?
<ol>
  <li>
    [slot#inner, document-fragment] <br>
    [slot#outer] <br>
    []<br>
    The first slotchange event is caused by slot#outer being transposed into slot#inner.
    This slotchange event occurs on a temporary DOM branch construction.
    A this point in time, portrait-frame is still being created and no childNodes is yet connected to its host element.
    Therefore, the slot#inner.assignedElements({flatten: true}) returns an empty list.
    This slotchange event is not really redundant, a slotchange explosion, because we should be alerted about the
    slot#inner getting transposed content. The main problem with this slotchange event is that it is coming too early.
  </li>
  <li>
    [slot#outer, slot#inner, document-fragment, green-frame#frameOne, document-fragment] <br>
    [pre, pre, pre, pre, pre, pre, pre] <br>
    [pre, pre, pre, pre, pre, pre, pre]<br>
    The second slotchange event is caused by all the pre elements being transposed into slot#outer.
    Important to note here is that this slotchange event is not dispatched on slot#inner, but bubbles *from*
    slot#outer *to* slot#inner. This is very strange, but it is because the flattened DOM looks like this:
    <pre>
...
  < portrait-frame >
    #shadowRoot
      ..
      < green-frame >
        #shadowRoot
          < slot#inner >
            < slot#outer >
              < pre >¯\_(ツ)_/¯
              < pre >  |   |
              ...
    </pre>
    The second slotchange event is the one we want. The problem with this slotchange event is that it really dispatched
    on slot#outer, not the slot#inner. It would be natural to assume that when the pre-nodes become transposed all the
    way into slot#inner, a slotchange event would be dispatched directly from slot#inner. This is not so. The reason the
    slotchange event listener for slot#inner receives a slotchange event is that this event will bubble all the way up
    to #shadowRoot under portrait-frame.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your browser displays _more than_ two slotchange events, don't worry. I will explain why this happens in the
    next example.
  </li>
