# Pattern 2: Isolated functional mixins for HTMLElement
Sometimes, the task of finding out **when** the reactive method should be triggered is not trivial.
This can be caused by several reasons:
* different browsers might implement different API that the element needs to harmonize/polyfill,
* information can be spread over several sources and require processing, 
thus filling the component with trivia that obfuscates the rest of the element logic, and/or
* the task of listening for the trigger can be made more efficient if it is 
coordinated for all the components, for example in a shared xObserver instance.

If the "listen to" part of the pattern balloons, then you likely want to split this functionality 
out as a separate functional mixins to isolate this aspect of your code to keep things simpler and 
facilitate unit-testing.

### Example 
In this example, we will convert the onlineOfflineCallback example above into a functional mixin.
This example is so simple, that it is likely that most developers would prefer not to split this 
code out as a separate listener. But, to explain the pattern, this "too simple" example is well suited.
```javascript
const OnlineOfflineMixin = function(Base)Â {
  return class extends Base {                                                  //listening management
      constructor(){
        super();
        this._onlineOfflineListener = e => this.onlineOfflineCallback(navigator.onLine);   
      }
      
      connectedCallback(){
        if (super.connectedCallback) super.connectedCallback();           //[1]
        window.addEventListener("online", this._onlineOfflineListener);   
        window.addEventListener("offline", this._onlineOfflineListener);  
        this.onlineOffline(navigator.onLine);                             
      }
                                                                
      disconnectedCallback(){
        if (super.connectedCallback) super.connectedCallback();           //[1]
        window.addEventListener("online", this._onlineOfflineListener);                   
        window.addEventListener("offline", this._onlineOfflineListener);                  
      }                                                                                                                                                                               
      //onlineOfflineCallback(isOnline) {
      //  don't implement this here                                       //[2]
      //} 
      
    }                                                                                     
};

class MyWebComponent extends OnlineOfflineMixin(HTMLElement) {
                                               
  connectedCallback(){                   
    super.connectedCallback();                                            //[3]      
    //do your stuff here
  }
                                                            
  disconnectedCallback(){                                                 //[3]
    super.disconnectedCallback();        //don't forget this
    //do your stuff here
  }
                                        
  onlineOfflineCallback(isOnline) {                                            //The reactive method
    if(isOnline)                                                                       
      console.log("Online! The world is your oyster.");                                
    else                                                                               
      console.log("Offline! Finally some piece of mind.");                             
  }                                                                                    
}                                                                                      
customElements.define("my-web-component", MyWebComponent);
```                                                                   
1. When you are using a functional mixin pattern on the `HTMLElement`, 
you might want to mix your mixins with other functional mixins.
These other mixins are almost always going to implement not only a `constructor`, 
but also their own `connectedCallback()` and `disconnectedCallback()`.
By calling any parent `connectedCallback()` and `disconnectedCallback()` before you run your code,
your functional mixin will be able to work together with other functional mixins.
ATT!! In the functional mixin, you must also check to see `if(super.connectedCallback)` and 
`if(disconnectedCallback)` exists before you call it. The reason is that `HTMLElement` doesn't have 
this method, and if your mixin is either at the core of the functional mixin cluster or
is used on its own, a direct call to a non-existing super.connectedCallback would throw an `Error`.
2. It is better not to implement `onlineOfflineCallback()`. The reason for this is that
if you use this functional mixin but then forget to implement the corresponding callback method in your
custom element class, then your code will throw an Error the first time the callback triggers.
This will likely help you remove functional mixins that you don't use anymore from your custom elements,
and this is very beneficial as listening for the callback triggers is likely to be a heavy task for the
browser to perform.
3. When you are using a functional mixin that uses `connectedCallback` and `disconnectedCallback`,
**you must remember to call `super.connectedCallback` and `super.disconnectedCallback`**. If you forget this,
the functional mixin will not be able to manage its listening task. This mirrors the behavior you do when
calling `constructor() { super(); ...` first when extending another class. 

### IsolatedFunctionalMixin
When separating code into a FunctionalMixin, the FunctionalMixin most likely can and will make some 
assumptions as to what resources is available in the Base prototype parameter. 
These assumptions form implicit bindings for the mixin, and in order for these implied dependencies 
to be manageable and scalable, they should adhere to strict limits. 

A mixin is isolated, **IsolatedFunctionalMixin** when it 
1. does not change the underlying Base prototype nor events, and  
2. only relies on a limited set of implied dependencies (such as the HTMLElement here in JoiComponents).

In JoiComponents all **first-level** IsolatedFunctionalMixins should depend only on HTMLElement as Base,
and **only** `constructor()`, `connectedCallback()`, and `disconnectedCallback()` (not `attributeChangedCallback()`). 
they should therefore not rely on and build on each other, and they should not change inherent properties 
nor events from that element. Second-level FunctionalMixins can be built by depending on one or more of 
established functional mixins ~around~ the Base, but it is recommended to not do so, but instead try to
either build additional first-level IsolatedFunctionalMixins around HTMLElement or put the needed functionality 
in the end result custom element.

### Is .render() an anti-pattern?
Using second-level FunctionalMixins, it is possible to create functional hooks for how a custom element
should react to certain events (other than as trigger a reactive method or dispatch a composed event).
One prime candidate use-case for such a second-level method is .render().
However, this creates a highly complex architecture around the FunctionalMixins themselves.

It is my opinion that ONLY **IsolatedFunctionalMixins** should be used to trigger only **reactive methods**
or dispatch **composed events**. Detecting **when** an external event occurs does **not** need to
depend on any custom functionality outside HTMLElement and the platform API. 
If the FunctionalMixin is given wider limits of dependencies apart from HTMLElement,
then the FunctionalMixin will cease to be limited only to platform resources and start to be dependent
on a shared "primary" resource / framework, however small that might be.
