# Theory: Design

> It is an impossible mission to explain shortly how to approach design and web design. I do it anyway.

## What is "design"?

Design is a language of communication. Design is meaningful. And so to do web design well means to communicate well via web, to play well in sync (or well out of sync) with your web readers. To get your point of view across so that the other sees your perspective. And the beauty or ugly or order or coherence or dissonance or whatever that you wish to convey.

We use normal languages to communicate in this way too. To create meaning together like this. And in many ways, design are *all the ways, except natural language we can communicate with each other*. Design are all the languages that we don't think of as language.

## The symbols and contexts of design

So, how do we communicate with design. What is the symbols of design? And how do we interpret these symbols, ie. what are the context of designs?

There are several dimensions of design, and in web design we have for example:

1. layout (and whitespace)
2. colors (and shade and light)
3. font (and symbols including emojis, logos)
4. images (and layout decoration)

These dimensions are not clear cut; they interplay and blend together. They also blend together with the text and language of the web site. They also play and blend together with UX. Interpreting design is not binary. It is not an exact science. Users will ascribe different meaning to the same design.

## Symbols and contexts of color

It is an open question if a three makes a sound in the forrest if no one is there to see it fall. But, for the purposes of web design, colors do not exist if no-one sees them. And, what colors mean, that is *connotated to* the light from the screen *by the users and web site authors*.

The user connotate (as in "add meaning to") the color light using several different sources (aka. contexts):

The **instinctive context** of colors is familiar to many web designers. `Red` is attention grabbing because it is the color of animal blood meaning, thus representing either danger or food to a mammal such as humans. Plants then developed red fruits and berries to grab the attention of mammals to get them to eat their fruits and thus spread their seeds with their fertilizing feces. Black and yellow is the color of poisonous wasps and reptiles. Green is the color of grass, and possibly prey and fruit. Lightblue is the color of shallow water. Light brown is the color of tan skin, white the color of healthy teeth.

But, as described above, colors are not interpreted in isolation, not even instinctively. Combine red with summer green, and you have a strawberry; combine red with black, and you have a deep wound. Blood usually don't present itself as a round berry. Berries don't spread out evenly on a square. The texture of blood is even. The texture of berries can be both even and granular. The grey rattle snake has scales. A stone surface has asymmetrical edges and texture.

The **cultural context** of colors is another domain. The friendly face of kindergarten has the bright colors of Google. Or was it the other way round. The police in the US is black and white in the US, yellow and blue in Sweden; the cabs in NY are yellow, the cabbies in London are black. Hospital white. Lawyers blue. Or earthy. Or maybe purple. Caf√© latte brown. If it is "on sale", it should be orange or red or maybe yellow.

And again. The colors are not in isolation. If you have an image, the colors you use will highlight "the things" with the same color in those images, transporting meaning from the image to the colored item on the web page. If there is color, there can also be a shapes that shape the users' associations for that color.

The **intra-textual context** of colors is the color-composition on the web page. Or web site, if you take a more interactive, 4D approach. Red is dramatic put up against an all white or all black background. It is less attention-grabbing squeezed in between orange and purple. Or light red against a white background. Or dark red against the black.

All the colors on a web site form a color palette. Which colors both should be harmonic, while at the same time contain colors that can be used together creating high and low contrast relationships. Two colors that contrast create a divide without using space; two colors that harmonize can bridge elements spread apart (across space in the page, across pages, and across space in time between different visits and different places). 

Thus, colors play on many strings: they play on our instinct, our native eye-brain-image-processor; they play together; they play with other cultural artifacts that we have colored in the past (or will color in the future); they play with imagery; they play with contrast and harmony. Just to name a few.

## Symbols and contexts of layout

As colors, layout is also full of symbols. Layout is the symbols of space. White space and filled space. The space between and the space within. The value of distance and proximity. Overlapping conflicts or overlapping embraces. Layout makes sense, or it doesn't, or is it doing something I don't yet understand?

As colors, layout is also interpreted "in context". It is not independent. Universal. It is ours. It is fleeting. It is trending and new, or worn out and old. To best understand these meaningful dimensions of layout, we need to understand more about how we interpret these invisible symbols of space, constraint, dimensions, and positions.

The **instinctive context** of layout is our perception of space in the world. We humans can build many geometrical models in our mind so that we can navigate our space. A round hole in a big stone is a potential cave in which to shelter for the night. Aim at the center of the round berry when you reach to pick it up. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. That sweet girl has a face full of symmetries. The golden ratio is 1.618, and that pattern means that this round thing is a pinecone of tasty seeds and not a hardened piece of dirt. And the FAB (floating action button) is bottom right, where your thumb is.

Geometric shapes are instinctively available to us. Babies can recognize a square from a circle from a star from a triangle as soon as they develop motor skills to put such pieces in a box. But. The instinctive context of layout is *not* the full picture. Its role is more that of a platform against which we interpret the other context.

Our **cultural context** of layout is filled with examples. We have seen lots of web sites. In the cultural sphere in which we operate at least. In fact, we have seen so many similar web sites that we have developed archetypal expectations of what different types of layout should look like and how they should behave. In English and other left-to-right cultures, text is aligned on the left. And if we have a menu, we should place it either to the left or up top on the screen: the choices should be presented *before* the chosen.

There are countless renditions of these archetypal layouts. Web sites lists all the common grids for web page composition. Break these archetypal conventions, and you are suddenly in the land of chaos: you must somehow find some new geometrical landscape in whose *forms* your users can recognize the different *functions* of your web site. And that is not easy. The archetypal layouts doesn't provide us with a landscape of forms. No. It provides us with a landscape of functions.

In linguistics, such communicative landscapes of functions are known as genres. Genres are best understood as "recurrent rhetorical actions" (Miller 1984: 155) that over time gets conventionalized in culturally recognizable schemas for verbal and designed communication. The genre contains a set of functions for interaction, and the schema assigns these functions a particular space. For example: a book needs an overview, space for text, way to search by keyword. The book schema is a table of contents, content pages, and an index. 

Web layout are the primary conveyor of genre. One quick look at a web site and the user has made up his mind about where he thinks the menu and text and contact info and log-in button etc. should be located. And even though we as developers so very often want to break free from these chains of convention and interact freely with ourselves and our users, the truth is that we often cannot. Layout freedom means that our users don't recognize our intentions; they don't understand what the web site *is doing*. And layout freedom means that we ourselves must be soo clear in our understanding of *what we want to do* as to be able to formulate it outside of established conventions.

Layout also works **intra-textually**. Text paragraphs are (commonly) aligned left. Left alignment produces a line of contrast that is easier for the eye to "hit" when it needs to jump from the right end of a line to the left beginning of the next during reading. A straight line produce a clearer block of text which in turn produces an instinctively simpler target for the eye.
 
 When a paragraph is aligned against the same vertical line as another paragraph, or an image, or a header, this alignment also signals coherence. This alignment is strongest when the content is positioned against the same left vertical line, as this would be the presumed target in "within paragraph reading mode". But, the vertical line in the center of the paragraph block and the line of the rightmost edge of the block also signal coherence.
 
The intra-textual relationships between layout blocks and white space are many. They arise from:
 * size: Does same size mean same importance? Big first, small second? 
 * ratio: Same dimensions around the images of the same types? Mama rectangle and baby rectangle? Man is square, and woman is circle of same size: but what then is that rectangle with rounded corners?
 * dimensions: Are those elements with the same width siblings? Do they play the same role? Are they positioned similarly in the hierarchy? Is a square a square?
 * alignment: elements aligned to the same vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line, should they be read in their order seen left to right? When a text block or image is skewed from a line of alignment already established, does it have any significance? Was the tab before the start of paragraphs created to break with the anticipated target position during "continuous reading", and should it be understood as an alternative means to an empty line to demarcate the break in content a paragraph shift is intended to signal? Will having both a tab at the beginning of and an empty line between paragraphs create too much distance between paragraphs, or is it ok? Can I push headers to the left to give them distance to the flow of "continuous reading" instead of padding above and/or below?
 * position: Is the middle the focus of attention? Or is the focus of attention the third middle section of a vertical line a third from the right? Or are the positions read interpreted from the golden ratio? 

## Web design: technically

Technically, the web aims to split verbal and design communication in two: HTML and CSS. HTML is the content. The home of text. CSS is the design. The home of colors and layout and fonts. Furthermore, as web pages became more interactive and dynamic, JS arose as a third leg. JS not only controlled interaction and reactions to user driven events, it also was used to direct layout and load and direct content.

This idea works for colors. And fonts. Styling colors and fonts separately in CSS works quite well. At least with todays complexity. But. CSS layout is a mess. CSS layout is both technically super complex. CSS layout is far too tightly bound to content to be managed independently.

The idea that design and content can be split in two sounds great. Design and content are separate, right? But, as all web developers know, it never quite works out that way. First, when you dig beneath the surface, there is an element of design and content and user interaction in everything. But, more importantly. Content and design and interaction interplay with each other: they are not independent. If your design is not in line and in harmony with what you are writing, it means something. And so when you try to split design from content along the CSS / HTML divide, your HTML content and CSS design always seem to end up a codependent mess full of reciprocal bindings.

In this chapter I will advocate a new approach managing design in web design:

> Do web design layouts as templates, genre schemas that are implemented as web components.
