# Problem: Styling `<SLOT>`s and flattening `<SLOT>`s

## Example 1: FancyHeader
                                         
In the following example an HTML is created with a custom element called `<fancy-header>`.
The `<fancy-header>` has a shadowDOM with a `<header-impl>` node.
The `<header-impl>` element only contains a `<style>` and a `<slot>`. 
The `<fancy-header>` uses a `<slot>` that it places in the slottable position of its `<header-impl>` node,
thus chaining its own `<slot>` to the `<slot>` in `<header-impl>`.

```html
<script>
  class FancyHeader extends HTMLElement {
    constructor(){
      super();
      this.attachShadow({mode: "open"});
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
        <style>
          slot {
            color: blue;
            text-decoration: line-through;
          }
        </style>
        <header-impl>
          <slot id="middle"></slot>          
        </header-impl>
      `;
    }
  }

  class HeaderImpl extends HTMLElement {
    constructor(){
      super();
      this.attachShadow({mode: "open"});
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
        <style>
          slot {
            color: red;
            text-decoration: underline;
          }
        </style>
        <slot id="inner"></slot>
      `;
    }
  }
  customElements.define("fancy-header", FancyHeader);
  customElements.define("header-impl", HeaderImpl);
</script>
<style>
  span {
    text-decoration: overline;
  }
</style>
<fancy-header><span>Hello World!</span></fancy-header>
```
This results is:

Hello World!  (with red underline, blue overline, and blue line-through) and BLUE(!).

### What happened?

First, `<span>Hello World!</span>` is transposed into `<slot id="middle">` and then into `<slot id="inner">`.
Now, looking at `<slot id="inner">` as variable to be resolved, 
we would expect that the `<slot id="inner">` is replaced with `<span>Hello World!</span>`.
But, wait, this is not how `<SLOT>`s are flattened! No, the `<span>Hello World!</span>` is
*filled into*/wrapped inside `<slot id="inner">`, so the end result in the flattened DOM would 
look something like:
```html
<slot id="inner">
  <span>Hello World!</span>
</slot>
```
But, wait again! This isn't exactly true either. What about `<slot id="middle">`? 
And the `blue` text color and `line-through`?
Ok, so the end result is wrapped in the `<slot id="middle">` too making the 
flattened DOM look something like this:
```html
<slot id="middle">
  <slot id="inner">
    <span>Hello World!</span>
  </slot>
</slot>
```
Ooops, I did a mistake there! I switched the `<slot>` order. When `<slot>`s are wrapped, 
they will go in the **reverse document order(!!)**. The inner will become the outer, and vice versa.
And so the "correct" expectation would be something like this:
```html
<slot id="inner">
  <slot id="middle">
    <span>Hello World!</span>
  </slot>
</slot>
```
And with this prescient mental image of the flattened DOM, the styles *finally* start to make sense.
First, the styles attributed to `<slot id="inner">` are attributed, red text and red underline.
Second, `<slot id="middle">` overwrites the text color in blue, and adds a line-through.
Third, the `<span>` adds an overline, that is blue because the text color is now blue.

The take-away from this example is the importance of:
1. making a mental model of the slotted nodes as **wrapped** in potentially several nested `<slot>`s.
2. The this embrace-of-the-slots is in **reverse document order**, 
   since flattening of `<slot>`s traverse the documents bottom-up.
3. That **all the styles of all the `<slot>`s apply**.

And if you are feeling confused, embrace it like a `<SLOT>`, 'cause there's more comin'!

## Example 1b: `<SLOT>`s inherit their parents style too

Let's play with this example a bit. Let's make it even more difficult, just for kicks!
Let us not apply the styles in the middle, `FancyHeader`, and the top level directly to the `<slot>`.
What happens then?

```html
<script>
  class FancyHeader extends HTMLElement {
    constructor(){
      super();
      this.attachShadow({mode: "open"});
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
        <style>
          b {
            color: blue;
            text-decoration: line-through;
          }
        </style>
        <b>
          <header-impl>
            <slot id="middle"></slot>          
          </header-impl>
        </b>
      `;
    }
  }

  class HeaderImpl extends HTMLElement {
    constructor(){
      super();
      this.attachShadow({mode: "open"});
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
        <style>
          slot {
            color: red;
            text-decoration: underline;
          }
        </style>
        <slot id="inner"></slot>
      `;
    }
  }
  customElements.define("fancy-header", FancyHeader);
  customElements.define("header-impl", HeaderImpl);
</script>
<style>
  span {
    text-decoration: overline;
  }
</style>  
<fancy-header><span>Hello World!</span></fancy-header>
```
Before we look at the result, let's look at some possible expectations:

Now, this time the text will be bold, from the `<b>` element. That is simple.
Also, another spoiler. There will be no `line-through`. As this property does not inherit. 
But, what about the text color? Which CSS rule will apply?
(And we pretend that it is not necessary to care about the color of the `overline`. 
Red or blue overline? Doesn't matter, they are both equally beautiful!)

There are two alternatives for text color: red and blue.

It could be blue. The rationale here would be that `color` is an inheritable CSS property. 
That means that `<slot id="middle">` inherits this property from its parentNode 
(which, spoiler alert, devtools shows).
So, even though the `<slot>` isn't directly colored anymore, it inherits color, and 
that inherited color trumps the more specific CSS selector from the inner document 
*because the owner documents of these rules are ordered in reverse-document-order*, 
making higher document rules trump lower document rules, regardless of specificity.

It could be red. The rationale here would be that CSS rules that are directly assigned to a node,
ie. *not* inherited, always trumps inherited properties, regardless of document order.

The result is...

"Hello World!"  (red text, red overline, red underline)

This shows us that specificity of CSS selectors for SLOT trumps CSS document order.
Feeling a bit more confused? Not to worry, the ride is not over yet, 
we have much more of the good stuff coming! :D

## Example 2: ::slotted(*)

To style nodes that get assigned, a special CSS selector called `::slotted(*)` is used. 
The `::slotted(*)` selector is a CSS pseudo-class, but what you really need to know, is that
you can *only* use it to style the directly assigned nodes, and not those nodes descendants.
**`::slotted(*)` rules *only* apply to assigned children, *not* assigned descendants**. 

Let's look at our fancy example, but this time we use `::slotted(*)`.
In this example we also sprinkle an extra css property to the middle layer `font-style: italic`.
It can never be too fancy!

```html
<script>
  class FancyHeader extends HTMLElement {
    constructor(){
      super();
      this.attachShadow({mode: "open"});
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
        <style>
          ::slotted(*) {
            color: blue;
            text-decoration: line-through;
          }
        </style>
        <header-impl>
          <slot id="middle"></slot>          
        </header-impl>
      `;
    }
  }

  class HeaderImpl extends HTMLElement {
    constructor(){
      super();
      this.attachShadow({mode: "open"});
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
        <style>
          ::slotted(*) {
            color: red;
            text-decoration: underline;
            font-style: italic;
          }
        </style>
        <slot id="inner"></slot>
      `;
    }
  }
  customElements.define("fancy-header", FancyHeader);
  customElements.define("header-impl", HeaderImpl);
</script>
<style>
  /*nothing ever gets ::slotted(*) at the root level*/
</style>
<fancy-header><span>Hello World!</span></fancy-header>
```

Take a guess! What color do you think the text will be? Red? or Blue? 
And will it be underlined, strike-through or both?
Which way is the `::slotted(*)` prioritized? Same way as document order, inner trumps outer?
Or the reverse chained-slot-order that we saw before, 
outer trumps inner, because inner `<SLOT>` becomes outer wrapper?

Hello World! (in blue, line-through, italics)

> If you are reading this, I just have to say: you are a superhero!! 
You *can* take more ups and downs than the next guy, you are *truly* the last man standing.
I do not expect this ever to happen, at this point I believe I am alone, writing only for myself.

First, If you look at the slotted `<span>` node in devtools, you will see 
that *both* the `::slotted(*)` rules gets attached to the `<span>` node.
The inner `::slotted(*)` rule just went right *past* the `<slot id="middle">` node.
And if you missed that one, no worries! That's on `::slotted(*)`, not you. 

Second, as all the rules gets attached to the same `<span>` node, they will overwrite each other.
You will not get one text-decoration for a `<slot id="middle">` node and one for the `<slot id="inner">`.
This time, you will get only one: the outer one. "What, the outer one?" you might ask. 
Yes, the outer one since applying CSS rules to slotted elements goes... yes, you are right...
**reverse document order**.

## Example 3: fallback nodes

To provide a default value for a `<SLOT>` if no elements are assigned to it,
you simply add a set of childnodes under it.
Child nodes of a `<SLOT>` element is that `<SLOT>` element's fallback nodes.
The principle is simple. 
If a `<SLOT>` element does not get any nodes assigned to it from outside (the lightDOM),
use the childNodes from the inside (the shadowDOM).

But, there is a catch. Since `<SLOT>`s are filled with assigned content, not replaced,
these fallback nodes are not regarded as `::slotted(*)`.
And, there is another catch. What if: 
1. an inner `<SLOT>` *is* assigned to a middle `<SLOT>` that 
2. is *not* assigned to any slotable nodes in its lightDOM, but 
3. *do* have a set of fallback nodes?

*Would* the inner `<SLOT>`:
 * use its own fallback nodes of the middle slot, or
 * the fallback nodes from the other `<SLOT>` element it is assigned to?
   
Let's have another `FancyHeader` and investigate:

```html
<script>
  class FancyHeader extends HTMLElement {
    constructor(){
      super();
      this.attachShadow({mode: "open"});
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
        <style>
          ::slotted(*) {
            color: blue;
            text-decoration: line-through;
          }
        </style>
        <header-impl>
          <slot id="middle">Middle Header</slot>
        </header-impl>
      `;
    }
  }

  class HeaderImpl extends HTMLElement {
    constructor(){
      super();
      this.attachShadow({mode: "open"});
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
        <style>
          ::slotted(*) {
            color: red;
            text-decoration: underline;
          }
        </style>
        <slot id="inner">Inner Header</slot>
      `;
    }
  }
  customElements.define("fancy-header", FancyHeader);
  customElements.define("header-impl", HeaderImpl);
</script>
<fancy-header></fancy-header>
```
"Middle header" (with no color or styling)

The example yields good insight. 
When `<slot id="inner">` asks `<slot id="middle">` for its `assignedNodes`, 
`<slot id="middle">` returns its fallback nodes ("Middle header") since it has no assigned nodes.

But.. It has no color? Meaning that none of the `::slotted(*)` rules apply. Why is that?

As the "Middle header" in `FancyHeader` is not slotted, but a fallback node, the `::slotted(*)`
CSS rule in `FancyHeader` does not apply. That's expected.
But, the `"Middle header"` text node is not a fallback node in `HeaderImpl`;
the `"Middle header"` node *is slotted into* `<slot id="inner">`.
So, why is `::slotted(*) {color: red; ... }` not applied? 
I cannot tell you.
This investigation concludes that in the intersection between `<slot>` fallback nodes and 
`::slotted` CSS rules there most likely is a bug.

## Example 4: Freakish `<SLOT>`s in the main document

> Def: "A freakish `<SLOT>`" is a `<SLOT>` node in main document.

There is really no point in adding `<SLOT>` elements in main document.
A `<SLOT>` must reside inside a shadowDOM in order to be assigned content too.
But what happens if by some freak accident a `<SLOT>` happens to end up there?

The short answer is: **a freakish `<SLOT>` is just a regular HTML element**.
The browser will make no attempt at assigning nodes to it. 
But, no `<slot>` example without a little twist.
As freakish `<SLOT>`s are considered regular HTML elements, 
if they are slotted into a custom element, they will not be ignored.

```html
<script>
  class FancyHeader extends HTMLElement {
    constructor(){
      super();
      this.attachShadow({mode: "open"});
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
        <style>
          ::slotted(*) {
            color: blue;
            text-decoration: line-through;
          }
        </style>
        <header-impl>
          <slot id="middle">Middle Header</slot>          
        </header-impl>
      `;
    }
  }

  class HeaderImpl extends HTMLElement {
    constructor(){
      super();
      this.attachShadow({mode: "open"});
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
        <style>
          ::slotted(*) {
            color: red;
            text-decoration: underline;
          }
        </style>
        <slot id="inner">Inner Header</slot>
      `;
    }
  }
  customElements.define("fancy-header", FancyHeader);
  customElements.define("header-impl", HeaderImpl);
</script>
<style>
  span {
    text-decoration: overline;
  }
</style>
<fancy-header><slot><span>Upper Fancy Header</span></slot></fancy-header>
```

What to expect this time? (Except no end in sight of the Slot+CSS-expectation-roller-coaster..)
First, we expect that the outer, freakish `<slot>` elements are treated roughly like an extra `<SPAN>`.
Second, as the `::slotted(*)` rules apply to a double span as they would a single span, 
we get more or less the same results as in "Example 2" above.

<img src="./svg/slotFreak.svg" width="100%" alt="diagram of slot freak example"/>

So:
1. while the existense of the freakish `<SLOT>` was unexpected, and
2. that a freakish `<SLOT>` is actively *not* flattened was unexpected, 
3. once these assumptions are corrected, the freakish `<SLOT>` behaves as expected.

## Discussion

The above examples are simple, believe it or not. 
They contain the bare minimum needed to illustrate how chained `<SLOT>`s get styled. 
They each have:
 * 3 documents,
 * 2-3 elements per document,
 * 1-2 styles per document,
 * one style CSS rule per document,
 * and CSS rules of the same type per example.
 
In the real world, things are not that simple. To help guide your work and protect your confidence
while working with styling `<SLOT>`s, we therefore provide the following guidelines:

## Guidelines: how to style `<SLOT>`s

1. Anticipate style creep when chaining `<SLOT>`s.
   It is naive to expect a `<SLOT>` to behave nicely. 
   Sure, they often do, and things work out ok in the end.
   But, when `<SLOT>`s get chained, things start going out of control, fast.
   The sad news is that you have to chain `<SLOT>`s. 
   You often want to use two or more `<SLOT>`s together at the same time, across many different elements,
   in many situations.
   Expect the most creepy situation going in, and 
   the chained `<SLOT>`s will hopefully pleasantly surprise you.

2. Remember: As variables, `<SLOT>` nodes are *filled with* content, not *replaced* by it.
   If there is style on the element you don't know where comes from, 
   you might just have overlooked that the middle slot is not replaced/vanished, but 
   still alive and kicking your slotted elements.
   If there are styles that are applied that you don't understand (style creep), 
   make the flattened DOM rendition for the slotted elements in *reverse document order*.
   
3. Remember: Lots of CSS selectors can hit your `<SLOT>`s' assigned nodes.
   Therefore, check the devltools, and see which selectors in which document 
   gets activated and prioritized.
   
4. Remember: CSS rules are inheritable. And that applies to `<SLOT>`s' assigned nodes too.
   That means that *both* CSS rules that are A) directly applied to your nested `<SLOT>` elements
   *and* B) applied to an ancestor of your your nested `<SLOT>` elements *apply*.
   
5. Remember: `::slotted(*)` only applies to the "assigned children" of a `<SLOT>`.
   "Assigned descendants" of a `<SLOT>` is not captured by the `*` 
   (as they would be by a `* { ... }` in regular CSS rule).
   
6. Remember: No element's fallback nodes are styled `::slotted(*)`, even when they are slotted. 
   
7. Remember: A `<SLOT>` node in the main document is *never* flattened.
