# Pattern: DeepState

DeepState is everywhere. You cant avoid it. 

Example of the teacher. Makes a lot of decisions about what should be taught and how.

The difference is not if it exists, it's if it works well. When it "works well" *for you*, you're happy, 
the world is how it should be. When it doesn't work as you wan't, the deeeeep state is working against you.

Distributed decisions made by underlings.

Pakistan:

1. corruption -> individual, not collective interest. Or subgroup interest going against your own, 
not sanctioned by democracy.

2. poly culture. Greatly varying social interests, religious beliefs, cultural truths etc.

3. Immature institutions. Lack of conventions. Clashes with pre-bureaucratic institutions and practices.

Norway:

1. Little corruption.

2. Mono culture. The ways and whys of decisions are the same, across/despite different levels and locations.
   Great deal of trust, the government underling will follow my ways and whys, and the government ways and whys,
   because we all mostly share them.

3. Well established institutions and borders between different institutions. Division of decisions honed in 
   and established. Good division of labour (cf. decisions).
