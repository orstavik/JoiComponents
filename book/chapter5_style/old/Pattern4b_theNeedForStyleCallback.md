# Pattern: the need for a style callback

use the `list-style` property:
1. the inside/outside requires rearranging the shadowDOM elements.
2. the names of dot and square etc. are developer shortcuts to simplify use.
3. the url requires the creation of an img element and putting then altering the shadowDOM.
