# Pattern: Batch process the CustomElement polyfill
The CustomElement polyfill relies on some costly functionality.
1. The CustomElement polyfill observes all mutations in the DOM while it is being 
loaded in order to identify new custom tags added during loading.
2. Whenever `customElements.define` is called, the CustomElement 
polyfill will traverse the entire document to try to find DOM-nodes that fit the 
new custom element definition.

Sometimes, you must pay this cost. And therefore, this behavior is there by default.
But, often you know that several `customElements.define` calls and/or parsing bigger pieces 
of the DOM can be grouped together *before* the customElements polyfill traverses 
and updates the DOM.
To achieve this the customElements polyfill need to be put on hold (paused) 
while several customElements dependent functions are run, and then restarted when
the process is complete.
This *batch processes* customElements reactions.

## Implementation: Adding a pause-button to the CustomElements polyfill?
To stop the customElements polyfill from doing its job, you call:
```javascript
if(window.customElements && customElements.polyfillWrapFlushCallback){
  customElements.polyfillWrapFlushCallback(function(flush){});
}
```
This method will both:
* *stop observation* of the mutations in the document and
* *intercept the DOM traversal* in response to `customElement.define` and 
supply it with a method that does nothing.

To restart the customElements polyfill, you call:
```javascript
if(window.customElements && customElements.polyfillWrapFlushCallback){
  customElements.polyfillWrapFlushCallback(function(flush){flush();});
  customElements.upgrade(document);                                     
}
```
This method will:
* reverse the interception of the traversal of the DOM in response to `customElement.define`,
so that calls to `customElement.define` will trigger upgrades of the DOM,
* but `customElements.polyfillWrapFlushCallback` does not trigger an upgrade of the DOM
by itself, and therefore you must call `customElements.upgrade(document)` to upgrade the DOM.

To make these two methods easily accessible, we add them under the globally accessible 
`window.WebComponents` object.

```javascript
window.WebComponents = window.WebComponents || {};
window.WebComponents.stopCEPolyfill = function(){
  if(window.customElements && customElements.polyfillWrapFlushCallback){
    customElements.polyfillWrapFlushCallback(function(){});
  }
}
window.WebComponents.startCEPolyfill = function(){
  if(window.customElements && customElements.polyfillWrapFlushCallback){
    customElements.polyfillWrapFlushCallback(function(flush){flush();});
    customElements.upgrade(document);                                     
  }
}
```

> **Recommendation:** Stop the customElements polyfill as soon as you have loaded it, and 
> restart it when the document has finished loading (DOMContentLoaded). This:
> * disables the costly observation of mutations in the DOM while loading, and 
> * batch processes multiple calls to `customElements.define` at startup.

## Example: FeatureDetectAndPolyfill with batched customElement reactions during loading
Here is the FeatureDetectAndPolyfill example that 
batches Custom Element reactions during the loading of document.
If you intend to load web components polyfills **sync**hronously, this is all you need.

```html
<html>
  <head>                        
    <script> /** Polyfill code **/
      //Setup: declare the function for loading script sync
      function loadScriptSync(url, onAsyncLoadAsString) {
        var newScript = document.createElement('script');
        newScript.src = url;
        onAsyncLoadAsString && newScript.setAttribute("onload", onAsyncLoadAsString);
        document.write(newScript.outerHTML);
      }
      
      //Setup: add methods for pausing customElements polyfill
      window.WebComponents = window.WebComponents || {};
      window.WebComponents.stopCEPolyfill = function(){
        if(window.customElements && customElements.polyfillWrapFlushCallback){
          customElements.polyfillWrapFlushCallback(function(){});
        }
      }
      window.WebComponents.startCEPolyfill = function(){
        if(window.customElements && customElements.polyfillWrapFlushCallback){
          customElements.polyfillWrapFlushCallback(function(flush){flush();});
          customElements.upgrade(document);                                     
        }
      }
    
      //step 1: feature detection
      var CE = window.customElements; 
      var SD = 'attachShadow' in Element.prototype && 'getRootNode' in Element.prototype;
      var ES6 = window.Promise && Array.from && window.URL && window.Symbol;
      var TE = !(function() {
        // no real <template> because no `content` property (IE and older browsers)
        var t = document.createElement('template');
        if (!('content' in t)) {
          return true;
        }
        // broken doc fragment (older Edge)
        if (!(t.content.cloneNode() instanceof DocumentFragment)) {
          return true;
        }
        // broken <template> cloning (Edge up to at least version 17)
        var t2 = document.createElement('template');
        t2.content.appendChild(document.createElement('div'));
        t.content.appendChild(t2);
        var clone = t.cloneNode(true);
        return clone.content.childNodes.length === 0 || 
               clone.content.firstChild.content.childNodes.length === 0;
      })();
      
      //step 2: load polyfill async based on feature detection
      const base = "https://rawgit.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/master/bundles/";
      if (CE && SD && TE && ES6) {                                                          //[1]                                 
      } else if (!CE && SD && TE && ES6) {                                                   
        loadScriptSync(base + "webcomponents-ce.js", "WebComponents.stopCEPolyfill();");       
      } else if (!CE && !SD && TE && ES6) {                                                  
        loadScriptSync(base + "webcomponents-sd-ce.js", "WebComponents.stopCEPolyfill();");    
      } else {Â /*if (!CE && !SD && !TE && !ES6) {*/                                          
        loadScriptSync(base + "webcomponents-sd-ce-pf.js",   
          "HTMLTemplateElement.bootstrap(document); WebComponents.stopCEPolyfill();");
      }
      
      //step 3: restart the customElements polyfill on DOMContentLoaded
      window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(){WebComponents.startCEPolyfill();});
    </script>
    
  </head>
  <body>
    <red-dot>\</red-dot>
    <script> /** APP code**/
      //my red-dot element
      class RedDot extends HTMLElement {
        connectedCallback(){
          this.style.background = "red";
          this.style.borderRadius = "50%";
          this.style.width = "150px";
          this.style.height = "250px";
        }
      }
      //app-specific loading method
      customElements.define("red-dot", RedDot);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
## Sync or async?
The only major drawback of this approach is that it will block the rendering of the main page 
until your web components polyfill has completed.
There are mitigating circumstances for the sync approach:
1. Fewer and fewer browsers need the webcomponents polyfills. 
So even though a minority of your users get a slower experience,
your users as a group might appreciate the loss of complexity in polyfilling 
swapped with added complexity of business functionality.
2. The problem of blocking the rendering of the main document can be alleviated 
by moving the script with the polyfills below other template code.

However, sometimes you cannot change the loading position of the polyfill, and/or 
you cannot wait for the polyfill to download and install before rendering the rest of the 
main document. In such instances, you need to load the polyfill **async**hronously.

To load the polyfills async, you need another pattern called [QueAndRecallFunctions](Pattern5_QueAndRecallFunctions.md).
This pattern is fairly independent, and will therefore be described on its own terms, 
before we again return and [FeatureDetectAndPolyfillAsync](Pattern6_FeatureDetectAndPolyfillAsync.md).

Here is a more [in-depth discussion of async vs sync loading of polyfills](Discussion_sync_vs_async_polyfilling.md).

TODO Exemplify "flickering layout" problems of slow customElements:
1. Lets say you have a web page with 10 different custom elements.
2. Each of these elements greatly change their size and shape and appearance once they get 
connected to the DOM. 
3. Now, if you update all these web components one by one, and 
these operations happens to be spread out across time and different frames.
4. Then your web page might completely change its appearance every time one 
of the elements gets updated, ie. 10 times or more.
