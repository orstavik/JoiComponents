# Pattern: FeatureDetectAndPolyfill

## Why polyfill web components sync?
Using the pattern for feature detection, 
we handle the variation in polyfilling for different browsers.
Put simply, FeatureDetection solves the problem of browser variation.

However, the web component polyfills are also invasive.
When polyfilling customElements and shadowDom,
the polyfills alter or affect many of the core DOM functions such as:
* .innerHTML
* todo list many of the centrally affected functions
* .customElements.define

If you run a function against the DOM, this function can produce 
vastly different results depending on whether the polyfill has been loaded or not.
And therefore, you most often need to ensure that your polyfill is loaded *before*
some other function in your web app runs. 
The simplest way to do ensure that your polyfill loads before another resource is run, is 
to load the polyfill *sync*.
                                                               
## Example: FeatureDetectAndPolyfillSync web components
Using the two patterns FeatureDetection and DynamicallyLoadScript we can compose a new pattern:
FeatureDetectAndPolyfill. We load the polyfill script **sync**. 

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script> /** Polyfill code **/
      //Setup: declare the function for loading script sync
      function loadScriptSync(url, onAsyncLoadAsString) {
        var newScript = document.createElement('script');
        newScript.src = url;
        onAsyncLoadAsString && newScript.setAttribute("onload", onAsyncLoadAsString);
        document.write(newScript.outerHTML);
      }
    
      //step 1: feature detection
      var CE = window.customElements; 
      var SD = 'attachShadow' in Element.prototype && 'getRootNode' in Element.prototype;
      var ES6 = window.Promise && Array.from && window.URL && window.Symbol;
      var TE = !(function() {
        // no real <template> because no `content` property (IE and older browsers)
        var t = document.createElement('template');
        if (!('content' in t)) {
          return true;
        }
        // broken doc fragment (older Edge)
        if (!(t.content.cloneNode() instanceof DocumentFragment)) {
          return true;
        }
        // broken <template> cloning (Edge up to at least version 17)
        var t2 = document.createElement('template');
        t2.content.appendChild(document.createElement('div'));
        t.content.appendChild(t2);
        var clone = t.cloneNode(true);
        return clone.content.childNodes.length === 0 || 
               clone.content.firstChild.content.childNodes.length === 0;
      })();
      
      //step 2: load polyfill async based on feature detection
      const base = "https://rawgit.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/master/bundles/";
      if (CE && SD && TE && ES6) {                                          
        loadMyElements();                                   //[1]
      } else if (!CE && SD && TE && ES6) {                                                   
        loadScriptSync(base + "webcomponents-ce.js");       //[2]
      } else if (!CE && !SD && TE && ES6) {                                                  
        loadScriptSync(base + "webcomponents-sd-ce.js");    //[3]
      } else {Â /*if (!CE && !SD && !TE && !ES6) {*/                                          
        loadScriptSync(base + "webcomponents-sd-ce-pf.js",  //[4] 
          "HTMLTemplateElement.bootstrap(window.document);" //[5]
        ); 
      }
    </script>
    
  </head>
  <body>
    <red-dot>\</red-dot>
    <script> /** APP code**/
      //my red-dot element
      class RedDot extends HTMLElement {
        connectedCallback(){
          this.style.background = "red";
          this.style.borderRadius = "50%";
          this.style.width = "150px";          
          this.style.height = "250px";
        }
      }
      //app-specific loading method
      customElements.define("red-dot", RedDot);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
1. **No polyfill needed** - This covers the bulk of Chrome and Safari (2/3 of the browsers).
2. **webcomponents-ce.js** - Safari 10.0-10.2 had support for shadowDom, but not Custom Elements. (ca.0.5%) 
3. **webcomponents-sd-ce.js** - This covers Firefox (10%) and Safari older than 10.0. 
4. **webcomponents-sd-cs-te.js** - This covers Edge and older browsers (IE) using es5. 
5. When using the polyfill for HTMLTemplate, the `HTMLTemplateElement.bootstrap(document)` method
is run to process any `template` elements already added to the DOM before the polyfill was registered.
If you *know* that no template elements has been added to the DOM prior to the polyfill being loaded,
this call is not necessary.

## Drawback of sync polyfills
However, as stated earlier, the main drawback of loading a script sync, is that it will:
* delay the rendering of later parts of the DOM, and
* delay the running of later scripts.

The most immediate cure for this ill, is to place the polyfill sync *after* the DOM template and scripts
that you want to be handled before the polyfill.

Another cure for this ill is to load the polyfill *async*.
However, to load polyfills async is not simple. In fact, it is fairly complex. 
It requires that all resources that depends on the async polyfill do some adaptations to que their 
dependent code so that it is only triggered once the web components polyfill is ready, and is triggered in 
the order likely assumed by the developer. This is tricky.

However, first, we will look at the [BatchCustomElementUpgrades](Pattern4_BatchCustomElementUpgrades.md) pattern.
This pattern makes the use of the customElements polyfill more efficient.
Then we will look at the pattern [QueAndRecallFunctions](Pattern5_QueAndRecallFunctions.md).
This pattern is needed to make our final pattern [FeatureDetectAndPolyfillAsync](Pattern6_FeatureDetectAndPolyfillAsync.md).
