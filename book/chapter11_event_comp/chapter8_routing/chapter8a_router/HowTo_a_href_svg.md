# HowTo: `<a href="...">` in SVG

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 10 10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
  <a xlink:href="https://outside.com/the/box">
    <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="10"/>
  </a>
</svg>
```

## `click` on an `<a xlink:href="...">` in inline SVG documents

When SVG elements are inlined into the HTML document, 
the user can click on SVG `<a xlink:href="...">` elements inside the SVG sub-document to 
trigger a navigating `click` event.
```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 1000 415"xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
   <rect x="10" y="10" width="300px" height="100px" fill="yellow" stroke="black"/>
      <a xlink:href="https://www.google.co.uk/" target="_top" fill="blue" font-size="58" >
        <text x="30" y="80">someLink</text>
      </a>
</svg>
```
`click`s from SVG `<a>` elements function similar to `click`s from HTML `<a>` elements,
with the following exception:

1. The `href` attribute must be prefixed with `xlink:`, resulting in an `xlink:href` attribute. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/href) 
   The `xlink:` prefix is deprecated, but as the plain `href` attribute is not supported in Safari 
   and older browsers, the `xlink:href` is the simplest means to provide cross-browser support.
   
2. The `rel` attribute is not supported in several browsers.
   
//todo check if the `href` works in Safari even though it is not supported.
//todo check if `rel` works even though it is not supported.
//todo verify that the xlink:href property populates the .href property in all browsers.

3. The `<a xlink:href>` is a `parentNode` of the `click` event's `target` the same way as in HTML.
   But SVG `<a>` elements themselves differ from HTML `<a>` elements:
   1. SVG `.nodeName` properties are lowerCase while HTML `.nodeName` properties are upperCase.
   2. The HTML `<a>` element's `.href` property is a simple string.
   However, the SVG `<a>` element's `.href` property is an object containing two strings: `baseVal`[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGAnimatedString/baseVal) (#5) and `animVal`[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/uk/docs/Web/API/SVGAnimatedString/animVal).
   SVG `<a>` elements can animate their `.href` property, so the active link is always
   the SVG `<a>` element's `.href.animVal` (as opposed to simply `.href` in HTML).
   
4. For more about where `<a xlink:href>` can be placed in SVG documents, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/xlink:href) [SVGWG](https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/linking.html#XLinkHrefAttribute) see [todo](max,find_a_tutorial here).

> Att! Links in SVG documents loaded from `<img src="something.svg" />` is not triggered by the browser.
> Navigating events can *only* be triggered from inline SVG documents.

## `<area href>`: `usemap`, not `ismap`

When adding the `usemap` attribute [MDN](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#attr-hyperlink-usemap) to an image, the image surface area can be filled with several different links.
These HTML links are not defined using the `<a>`-tag, but with a brand new link tag: `<area>`[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/image-maps.html#the-area-element).

The `<img>`=>`<map><area /></map>` structure is a bit verbose:
1. The image element must include a `usemap` attribute to specify the map, ie. `<img usemap='#myMap'>`.
2. A `<map name='myMap'>` [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/map) [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/image-maps.html#the-map-element) element is created, and filled with one or more `<area>` elements.
3. `<area>` elements must declare what space over the picture they describe using the
`shape` and `coords` attributes.
4. The `<area>` elements can include the link attributes `href`, `rel`, `download`, and `target`
same as `<a>` elements. 

```html
<map name="notSoPopularAfterAll">
  <area shape="circle" coords="20,20,20"
        id="three"
        rel="noopener"
        href="https://specification.com/see/what/happens/when/spec/is/based/on/use.case"
        target="_blank" alt="This is an example of what happens when the spec is made too close to the use case" accesskey="p"/>
</map>

<img src="myMapPicture.jpg" usemap="#notSoPopularAfterAll" width="100" height="100" alt=a" />
```

`<area href="...">` links are triggered the same way as `<a href="...">` links.
So, when a user `click`s on an `<img usemap='#myMap'>` that is covered by an `<area>` in that `<map>`,
then the event target will be that `<area>` element and it will bubble from that location in the document. 
The `<img>` will not be part of that `composedPath`.

`<map>`-and-`<area>` is an old technology. Like `<table>` [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/tables.html#the-table-element).
Today, web developers can make similar structures with CSS.
For example, empty `<a href="...">` blocks with absolute position and size 
can be added inside a container `<div>` with a background image. 
[todo](make a test that this pattern can actually be done)

The benefit of using CSS-based alternatives to the `<img>`-and-`<map>`-and-`<area>` pattern are:
 * that such CSS-based patterns are more familiar and developer friendly, and 
 * more flexible and powerful.

Thus, `<map>`-and-`<area>` can best be understood as an old custom element pair.
The `<map>`-and-`<area>` pattern should be viewed as a "custom element pair" because 
the use-case it supports is a rare occurrence, not a common occurrence such as `<a>` and `<div>`s.
The `<map>`-and-`<area>` pattern should be viewed as old since the development of CSS
alternative patterns has long ago surpassed it.
This is why most web developers don't use or know about `<map>`-and-`<area>`.

Needless to say, a good argument can be made to deprecate `<map>`-and-`<area>`.
However, as `<map>`-and-`<area>` are still supported by both the standard and browsers, 
`<area>` elements are still a separate source of navigating events.

## What is the `<form>`?

`<form>` elements serve a couple of key navigation purposes:

1. Technically, `<form>` is the HTML way to send `POST` requests. 
   `POST` requests are web requests that in addition to a web resource's URL address can contain
   a compressed, large data packet.
   Small data packets can also be included in `GET` requests, but this data is added *inside* the
   URL as a query `?key=value&another=thing`, and this limits both data size and security.

   `<a href="...">` elements always produce `GET` request navigating events, and
   while `POST` requests can be produced by other means in JS [(MDN: Ajax)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX/Getting_Started),
   HTML only do so via `<form>` elements.
   
2. When large data navigating requests are made, 
   its data not only needs to be stored, but also sculpted *somewhere* and from *something*.
   In HTML, that *somewhere* is a `<form>` and 
   the *somethings* are `<input>`, `<checkbox>`, `<button>`, `<textarea>` children of the `<form>`.
   
   Think of the `<form>` navigating event as a potato head toy.
   On the potato, the child can pin eyes and mouths and noses from a selection that comes with the toy 
   (cf. `<checkbox>`, `<select>`).
   In addition, pieces of colored clay, cloth, rope and pins can be stitched to the potato as 
   different forms of hat, scarf and warts (cf. `<input>`, `<textarea>`).
   Depending on the flexibility of the "somethings" that accompany the potato,
   the child can make potentially unique potato heads every time.
   
   Conceptually, this differs from `<a href="...">`.
   Navigating events from `<a href="...">`s are closed, binary.
   They are simple yes-and-no-questions from the developer to the user.
   Navigating events from `<form>`s are open, infinite. 
   They are a container in which the user can fill his own content.
   
Practically, web developers often use JS to alter the links of `<a href="...">` 
so to make them more 'formish'. 
Similarly, many `<form>`s are so closed to the user that could better be presented as `<a>` list.
Still, `<form>` and `<a href>` approach navigation from different sides of the spectrum,
the open vs. closed, the composed vs. binary, the yes-and-no-question link vs. the potato-head link.

## `submit` events from `<form>` elements 

While `<a href="...">` and `<area href="...">` only emit raw, unprocessed `click` and `keypress` 
navigating events, `<form>` elements emit its own navigating `submit` event.
The `submit` event does not explicitly process the navigating event data, 
but it contains a `.target` pointer to the `<form>` element from where it originates.
This `target`, `<form>` element in turn contains:
1. an `.elements` property which contains the registry of all its 
   `<input>`, `<checkbox>`, `<button>`, `<textarea>` children.
2. the `action` attribute

//todo where do i find which button is the one submitting?
//todo which attributes of the form are navigation specific?

`submit` events can be generated when:
 * the user clicks on a submitting button, 
 * a submitting button is in focus and the user presses 'enter',
 * the user presses an `accesskey` associated with a submitting button,
 * a script triggers a submitting button using JS API such as `HTMLElement.click()` or
   `HTMLElement.dispatchEvent()`.

However, because the browser also provide a native `submit` event after 
these `click` and `keypress` events have been processed, 
we do not need to worry about the details of how navigating events from `<form>`s are triggered
(except the [Problem: NavigateTorpedo (`.submit()`)](todo next chapter).)





   * `HTMLElement.click()` [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click)
    [WHATWG]() or
   * `HTMLElement.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent("click", {bubbles: true, composed: true, cancelable: true}))`.
 * using a shortcut specified with the `accesskey` attribute on an element 
   (for instance, `<a href="#down" accesskey="d">scroll down</a`> will trigger a `click` event
   when the user presses `alt`+ `d`.)
    (todo does the accesskey shortcut first bubble as a keypress?? or is it translated into a click *before* it enters the browser's JS context??)
                                                                        

## Implementation tips

 * Identifying and filtering `click` and `keypress` events for navigating events is a pure function.
   You do not need any contextual information to identify which events are potential navigation. 
   You do need contextual information about the `<base>`, but that is needed when links are interpreted, 
   not created and navigating events initially dispatched.

 * `.preventDefault()` must be called synchronously when the navigating event is first caught.
If the processing of the navigating event The act of blocking the native router from Take care Avoid testing navigation events in Mocha.
as it is difficult to call `.preventDefault()` in the right locations.
  When making unit tests for navigation events, do so without a unit test framework.
