Sometimes, in the midst of an EventSequence, it can seem as if the mouse has got a will of its own.
Its own behavior or default action that seem to come out of nowhere.
It doesn't happen all the time.
But near some elements, the mouse does something completely unexpected: it selects text. 

When you make an EventSequence, this behavior is often unwanted. You have a completely different agenda,
you are doing something else. So, what do you do? You GrabMouse.

## GrabMouse's defaultAction

To control the defaultAction of text selection by mouse, there is currently one main alternative:
CSS property [`user-select`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select).

You might have expected that this event would be controlled from JS via the [`.preventDefault()`]() 
of `mousedown` or `mousemove`, or from HTML as an attribute. But no. The default action of the mouse is
far harder to both read and understand than that.

First, there are no HTML attributes to control mouse events, you can only control it from HTML via 
adding the CSS property `user-select` to the `style` attribute.
                                            
Second, from JS you can control text selection via a separate event `select`. This event could be
understood as a composed event that should be preventable from its preceding `mousedown` and `mousemove` event,
but it isn't. The `select` event is unpreventable and will in the same way as `click` is dispatched 
regardless of any `.preventDefault()` calls on its preceding `mouseup` event.

This could spell trouble. If the `user-select` CSS property was read, captured, and locked *before* 
the `mousedown` event was dispatched. However, it is not. If you set the `user-select` property during
the trigger event function for `mousedown`, you will control the text selection behavior.

To control the actions of mouse events during an EventSequence, we therefore need to:
1. set `user-select: none` on the `<html>` element when the sequence starts (ie. on `mousedown`) and
2. restore the the `<html>` element's original `user-select` value when the sequence ends 
   (ie. on `mouseup` and/or `mouseout`, cf. the ListenUp pattern). 

However. `user-select` is an experimental technology and not supported by old IE.
And the `select` event is. To ensure maximum control, adding a secondary event trigger for the `selectstart`
event and calling `.preventDefault()` on this event will ensure that no text selection will occur 
during your mouse-oriented EventSequence.

## GrabMouse's getaways

Sometimes, when handling mouse events, the mouse will breakout from your control. 
When the mouse tries to getaway from your control, you should not attempt to stop it.
When that happens, you need to abort your current EventSequence and reset the situation.
But, you must detect when the mouse escapes you, so that you asap can politely excuse yourself and 
restore normality.

To illustrate how mouse events get away from your control in the midst of your EventSequence with it,
we will make a safe `long-press`.

## Example: Safe `long-press`

To make a safe `long-press` we need to GrabMouse first. GrabMouse will prevent native text selection 
behavior from interfering with our custom composed DOM EventSequence. We grab the mouse by adding
the `user-select: none` attribute to the `<html>` element while the EventSequence is active and 
resetting the `<html>` element's `user-select` style property afterwards.
To make extra certain that no text selection will occur, we add an extra event listener on the 
`startselect` event and only call `preventDefault()` on it.

In addition, we do damagecontrol on three potential mouse jailbreaks:

1. The mouse pointer is moved out of bounds (outside of the scope of the window object). 
   An undetected `mouseup` that occurs if the mouse cursor is removed from the viewport of browser window
   when the user "unclicks". To prevent this accident, an extra secondary trigger event listener is added 
   for `mouseout`. If the `mouseout` is taken outside of the viewport of the window, this will cancel the `long-press`.

2. The user triggers the primary trigger function twice, before ending the EventSequence.
   This can happen if the user presses in a second mouse button, after the EventSequence have started. 

3. A script triggers `alert("bad")` while the EventSequence is running.

The resulting composed event trigger function looks like this:

```javascript
function dispatchPriorEvent(target, composedEvent, trigger) {
  composedEvent.preventDefault = function () {
    trigger.preventDefault();
    trigger.stopImmediatePropagation ? trigger.stopImmediatePropagation() : trigger.stopPropagation();
  };
  composedEvent.trigger = trigger;
  return target.dispatchEvent(composedEvent);
}

var primaryEvent;                                               //[1]
var userSelectCache;                                            //[1]

function startSequenceState(e){                                 //[1]
  primaryEvent = e;                                     
  window.addEventListener("mouseup", onMouseup);             
  window.addEventListener("mouseout", onMouseout);           
  window.addEventListener("focusin", onFocusin);           
  window.addEventListener("startselect", onStartselect);           
  userSelectCache = document.children[0].style.userSelect;
  document.children[0].style.userSelect = "none";
}

function resetSequenceState(){
  primaryEvent = undefined;                                     
  window.removeEventListener("mouseup", onMouseup);             
  window.removeEventListener("mouseout", onMouseout);           
  window.removeEventListener("focusin", onFocusin);           
  window.removeEventListener("startselect", onStartselect);           
  document.children[0].style.userSelect = userSelectCache;
}

function onMousedown(e){                                        
  if (primaryEvent)                                             //[2]
    resetSequenceState();                                       
  if (e.button !== 0)                                           
    return;
  startSequenceState(e);                                        //[1]     
}

function onMouseup(e){                                          
  var duration = e.timeStamp - primaryEvent.timeStamp;
  //trigger long-press iff the press duration is more than 300ms ON the exact same mouse event target.
  if (duration > 300 && e.target === primaryEvent.target)       
    e.target.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("long-press", {bubbles: true, composed: true, detail: duration}));
  resetSequenceState();                                         
}

var onMouseout = function (trigger){                            //[3]
  //filter to only trigger on the mouse leaving the window
  if (trigger.clientY > 0 && trigger.clientX > 0 && trigger.clientX < window.innerWidth && trigger.clientY < window.innerHeight)
    return;                                                     
  primaryEvent.target.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("long-press-cancel", {bubbles: true, composed: true}));
  resetSequenceState();                                         
}

var onFocusin = function (trigger){                           //[3]
  e.target.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("long-press", {bubbles: true, composed: true, detail: duration}));
  resetSequenceState();                                         
}

var onStartselect = function (trigger){                           //[4]
  trigger.preventDefault();
  return false;
}

window.addEventListener("mousedown", onMousedown);              
```
1. As the sequence configuration grows in complexity, we create a separate method `startSequenceState(e)`.
   The `startSequenceState(e)` has the responsibility of both ListenUp and TakeNote: 
   setting up listeners and initializing the EventSequence state.
 
2. If the user presses down two mouse buttons at the same time, the `long-press` EventSequence might
   try to initialize itself again while it is already running. 
   This would cause confusion, and so the `long-press` event will cancel itself in such instances.
   
3. If the `mouse` cursor moves out of the `window`, this would likely cause confusion, and so will
   instead also simply cancel the event.
   
4. If an `alert(...)` was triggered during the EventSequence, this would trigger a change of focus and a
   `focusin` event. Any `focusin` event would be considered a disturbance and cancel the EventSequence.
