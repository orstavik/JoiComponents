# Event: PinchSpin

* EarlyBird, CallShotgun
* ReplaceDefaultAction (not PriorEvent nor AfterthoughtEvent)
* FilterByAttribute                                                                         
* EventSequence
* EventAttribute
* TakeNote
* ListenUp
* GrabTarget
* GrabTouch, for the mouse and touch version respectively.

The only thing to save by having them as one, is lines of code for for example the ReplaceDefaultAction
and FilterByAttribute patterns.
