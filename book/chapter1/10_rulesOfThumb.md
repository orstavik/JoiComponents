# Web component rules of thumb

1. Don't use `this.innerHTML`.
   Custom elements have a host element. 
   The host element exists in an HTML `document` *outside* the custom element.
   To reach *outside* of the custom element and change the `document` on the outside 
   is likely going to cause conflicts, code in one element/document that changes properties
   of another element/document with negative consequences.
   
   `this` inside a custom element refers to the host element.
   `this.innerHTML` therefore changes the ***lightDOM*** children of the element.
   So, in reuseable custom elements, `this.innerHTML` should not be used.
   
   Alternative: `this.shadowRoot.innerHTML`.
   
2. Don't use `this.style`.
   The same principles that applied to `innerHTML` and changing the **lightDOM** children 
   of the host element applies to style.
   Changing such properties on an element is likely going to cause conflicts.
   
   Alternative: add a `<style>` element inside the **shadowDOM** of a custom element.
   
3. Don't use `this.classList.add`

   The same principles that applied to `this.innerHTML`, `this.style` 
   and changing the **lightDOM** children of the host element applies to CSS classes.
   Changing such properties on an element is likely going to cause conflicts.
   
   Alternative: set HTML attributes instead of CSS classes on the element. 
   HTML attributes are intended as an element state conveyor between the inside and outside of HTML elements.
   
4. "TypeError: Illegal constructor"
   
   You forgot to add customElements.define() of your new subclass of HTMLElement.
   
5. Use `element.tagName === "SLOT"` instead of `element instanceof HTMLSlotElement`.
   
   The polyfill has the `HTMLUnknownElement` class for its elements, not their proper class type.
   
6. Don't use `setAttributes(...)` or `getAttribute(...)` in the constructor. 
   Attributes are assigned to web components after the construction of the element.
   
7. don't rely on attributes being set in the element. Expect every attributes default value to be unset.
   Use different CSS values to select active DOM as a `:host([attribute="value"])`


## Core web component patterns:
 * The internal workings of the `shadowDom` should only be observed and controlled 
   by the custom element itself.
 * Custom elements should not reach into and make changes to its `host` node's lightDOM context.
 * Custom elements should not make any assumptions about its `host` node's lightDOM context.
 * Changes to a custom elements lightDom are passed on to the custom element via established,
   universal mechanisms such as lifecycle callbacks, events in general and `slotchange` event in
   particular.
