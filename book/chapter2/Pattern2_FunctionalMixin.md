# Pattern: FunctionalMixins
Finding out **when** a reactive method should be triggered is often complex:
* Different browsers might listen for/observe external events using different API that must all be added.
* Different browsers might have slightly different timing and/or environment state that must be harmonized.
* Information concerning the browser state might be spread across over several different sources.
* Information concerning the browser state might be raw and require parsing and/or computation.
* Information concerning the browser state might require caching data over time. 
* Observing for multiple components of the same type as one can be more efficient than observing multiple components one by one.
(cf. [SlotchangeMixin](Old_Mixin2_SlotchangeMixin.md) and [ResizeMixin](Mixin2_ResizeMixin.md)).

Therefore, a good listener method often require a few lines of code, both simple and complex.
If this code is put in the same scope as the code that reacts to the event, 
the code quickly balloons and becomes unwieldy as the listener code and the reaction code obfuscate each other.
When this happens, you want to split the listening functionality out as a separate functional mixin. 
This establishes a separate scope for the listening code, isolates it from the reaction, thereby 
making the code simpler and easier to unit test.

### Example 
In this example, we will convert the [`.onlineOfflineCallback(isOnline)`](Pattern1_ReactiveMethod.md)
example from the previous chapter into a functional mixin.

```javascript
const OnlineOfflineMixin = function(Base)Â {                              //[0] listening
  return class extends Base {                                                  
      constructor(){
        super();
        this._onlineOfflineListener = e => this.onlineOfflineCallback(navigator.onLine);   
      }
      
      connectedCallback(){
        if (super.connectedCallback) super.connectedCallback();           //[1]
        window.addEventListener("online", this._onlineOfflineListener);   
        window.addEventListener("offline", this._onlineOfflineListener);  
        this.onlineOffline(navigator.onLine);                             
      }
                                                                
      disconnectedCallback(){
        if (super.connectedCallback) super.connectedCallback();           //[1]
        window.addEventListener("online", this._onlineOfflineListener);                   
        window.addEventListener("offline", this._onlineOfflineListener);                  
      }                                                                                                                                                                               
      //onlineOfflineCallback(isOnline) {
      //  don't implement this in ReactiveMethod,                         //[2]
      //  but implement this for EventComposition                         //[2]
      //} 
    }                                                                                     
};

class MyWebComponent extends OnlineOfflineMixin(HTMLElement) {            //[0] reaction
                                               
  connectedCallback(){                                                    //[3]
    super.connectedCallback();                                            //don't forget this      
    //do your stuff here                                                  
  }
                                                            
  disconnectedCallback(){                                                 //[3]
    super.disconnectedCallback();                                         //don't forget this
    //do your stuff here
  }
                                        
  onlineOfflineCallback(isOnline) {                                       //[0] The reactive method
    if(isOnline)                                                                       
      console.log("Online! The world is your oyster.");                                
    else                                                                               
      console.log("Offline! Finally some piece of mind.");                             
  }                                                                                    
}                                                                                      
customElements.define("my-web-component", MyWebComponent);

0. When setting up a FunctionalMixin, the code of the ReactiveMethod is split into two parts:
* a functional mixin responsible for listening for the external event, and
* a web component applying this mixin to its HTMLElement superclass that 
controls the reaction of the external event.
                                                                  
1. When you are using a functional mixin pattern on the `HTMLElement`, 
you often want to use many mixins at the same time.
These other mixins are almost always going to implement not only a `constructor`, 
but also their own `connectedCallback()` and `disconnectedCallback()`.
By calling any parent `connectedCallback()` and `disconnectedCallback()`,
your functional mixin will be able to work together with other functional mixins on HTMLElement.
But. HTMLElement itself *does not* implement `connectedCallback()` and `disconnectedCallback()`.
Therefore, you must first check `if(super.connectedCallback)` and `if(disconnectedCallback)` exists 
before calling them.

2. If you are making an IsolatedFunctionalMixin for a ReactiveMethod,
you most often should not implement `.onlineOfflineCallback(isOnline)` in the mixin function.
If you add this mixin to your class, but then forget or later stop using the callback method,
the event will trigger an Error the first time the underlying event is triggered. 
This will remind you to either implement the callback or remove the mixin 
(which probably perform some not trivial observations that should be considered too costly to just
be left lying around).
However, if you use the IsolatedFunctionalMixin pattern for EventComposition as described in the
next chapter, you will of course implement an equivalent of this method in the mixin.

3. When you are using a functional mixin that uses `connectedCallback` and `disconnectedCallback`,
**you must remember to call `super.connectedCallback` and `super.disconnectedCallback`** in the component itself. 
If you forget this, you will not get an Error, but the functional mixin will not be activated or deactivated.
This closely resemble the compulsory call to `super()` in the `constructor()` of any class that extends another class.
